--Fixing NULL Values:

UPDATE WorldCupMatches

**ANALIZING THE DATA**:

--Country with most wins:

SELECT Winner, COUNT (Winner) AS most_wins
  FROM WorldCups
  GROUP BY Winner
  ORDER BY most_wins DESC
  
  Answer: Brazil, with 5
  
--Country with most second_place
  
  SELECT Runners_Up, COUNT (Runners_Up) AS most_second_place
  FROM WorldCups
  GROUP BY Runners_Up
  ORDER BY most_second_place DESC
  
  Answer: Germany, with 4 (Considering Germany as one country, since Data splits Germany into East and West Germany. Germany FR stands for West Germany.
  Combining them would give 4. If keeping the split, then the result is Argentina, Germany FR and Netherlands, with 3 second places each)
  
  --Which year had the most goals scored:
  
  SELECT Year, Country, MAX (GoalsScored) as number_of_goals
  FROM WorldCups
  GROUP BY Year, Country
  ORDER BY number_of_goals DESC
  
  Answer: 1998 (in France) and 2014 (in Brazil) had the most number of goals scored, with 171 goals in those years
  
  --Which year had the least goals scored:
  
  SELECT Year, Country, MAX (GoalsScored) as number_of_goals
  FROM WorldCups
  GROUP BY Year, Country
  ORDER BY number_of_goals 
  
  Answer: 1934 (in Italy) and 1930 (in Uruguay), with 70 goals in those years
  
  --What is the Average number of goals:
  
  SELECT AVG (GoalsScored) as number_of_goals
  FROM WorldCups
  ORDER BY number_of_goals DESC
  
  Answer: 121.3 goals/year
  
  
  **THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS HAD TO BE DONE USING THE TABLES WORLDCUPMATCHES AND WORLDCUP_2018. SINCE THERE WAS NO PRIMARY KEY, UNION WAS USED**
  
  --What is the maximum amount of times that the same Referee was used in different matches?
  
 SELECT Year, Referee, COUNT (Referee) AS number_of_matches
FROM WorldCupMatches
GROUP BY Referee, Year

UNION

SELECT Year, Referee, COUNT (Referee) AS number_of_matches
FROM WorldCup_2018
GROUP BY Referee, Year
ORDER BY number_of_matches DESC

Answer: 5 times. There were 4 Referees that were used in 5 different matches. Years 2006, 2010 and 2018.

--Which match had the most Attendance?

SELECT Year, Stage, Home_Team_Name, Away_Team_Name, Stadium, City, MAX(Attendance) as attendance_number
FROM WorldCupMatches
GROUP BY Attendance, Year, Stage, Home_Team_Name, Away_Team_Name, Home_team_goals, Away_team_goals, Stadium, City

UNION

SELECT Year, Stage, Home_Team_Name, Away_Team_Name, Stadium, City, MAX(Attendance) as attendance_number
FROM WorldCup_2018
GROUP BY Attendance, Year, Stage, Home_Team_Name, Away_Team_Name, Home_team_goals, Away_team_goals, Stadium, City
ORDER BY attendance_number DESC

Answer: Brazil X Uruguay, on the Finals on 1950, with 173850 people. It was on Maracana Stadium, in Rio de Janeiro
